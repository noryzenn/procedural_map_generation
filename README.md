# 🧩 Maze Generator & Pathfinding Visualizer (C++ / SFML)

A visual maze generation and pathfinding project built using C++ and SFML.

This project demonstrates algorithmic maze generation and shortest-path finding with real-time, step-by-step visualization. It allows users to watch the computer carve out a perfect maze, interactively select their start and finish points, and watch Dijkstra's algorithm hunt for the most efficient route.

## 🎮 Interactive Controls

Once the maze is fully generated, you can interact with the grid:

* **Left Click (1st time):** Sets the **Start** point (Red).
* **Left Click (2nd time):** Sets the **Finish** point (Green).
* **Press `S`:** Starts the Dijkstra Pathfinding visualization.
* **Press `ESC`:** Closes the window.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is divided into two main, fully completed parts:

### 🟢 Part 1 — Maze Generation (Completed ✅)

The maze is generated using the **Recursive Backtracking** algorithm (Depth-First Search with a stack). It creates a "perfect maze" (a maze with no loops and exactly one path between any two cells).

**🔎 How It Works:**

1. Start from the first cell and mark it as visited.
2. Randomly select one unvisited neighboring cell.
3. Remove the wall between the current cell and the neighbor.
4. Push the neighbor onto the stack and move to it.
5. If a cell has no unvisited neighbors, backtrack using the stack.
6. Repeat until all cells are visited.

**✨ Features:**

* Real-time visualization of the generation process.
* Visited cells are colored grey, and the active cell is highlighted.
* Walls are dynamically removed on screen.

### 🔵 Part 2 — Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Completed ✅)

Finds the absolute shortest path between the user-selected start and finish cells using a **Priority Queue**.

**🔎 How It Works:**

1. Assigns a distance value to every cell (infinity initially, 0 for the start cell).
2. Explores unvisited accessible neighbors (where walls don't block the path) starting from the lowest distance.
3. Updates the neighbors' distances and records the "previous" cell to remember the path.
4. Once the finish cell is reached, it backtracks through the "previous" cell records to reconstruct and draw the final shortest path.

**✨ Features:**

* Step-by-step visualization of the search radius (explored cells highlighted in orange).
* Accounts for generated walls (will not cross unbroken wall lines).
* Final shortest path is reconstructed and painted red.
